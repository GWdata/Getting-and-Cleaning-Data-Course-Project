The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains the code to perform the analysis described in the 5 steps. 

The output of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
